```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
vel <- c(20.5, 20.5, 30.5, 40.5, 48.8, 57.8)
stopdist <- c(15.4, 13.3, 33.9, 73.1, 113.0, 142.6)

raw <- data.frame("velocity" = vel, "stop_distance" = stopdist) %>% 
  mutate(
    "sqrt_stop_dist" = sqrt(stop_distance)
  )

raw %>% head()
```

# linear model as Y~X

```{r}
out <- lm(raw$stop_distance~raw$velocity)

out %>% 
  summary()
```

thus our regresstion line is Y = -62.0454 + (3.4930)X

```{r}
plot(raw$velocity, out$residuals)
```

# Linear model as $\sqrt{Y}$~X

```{r}
sqrt_out <- lm(raw$sqrt_stop_dist~raw$velocity) 

sqrt_out%>% 
  summary()
```

thus our regresstion line of $\sqrt{Y}$ = -0.877568 + (0.227724)X



```{r}
plot(raw$velocity, sqrt_out$residuals)
```
