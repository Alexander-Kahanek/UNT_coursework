### Instructions
1. This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button, all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.
2. Fill in the code chunks and submit this R markdown file to the assignment on Canvas. Make sure when you save that you have run all cells, so the outputs displace between the cells.
3. make sure to replace the directoryID in the filename with your student ID.
